# Mechanic Shop API

This is an API with CRUD endpoints for users, mechanics, and service tickets for an auto shop.

You will need a MySQL database on your machine named 'mechanic_shop' for this to run.

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a .env file at the root level with the following line:
   MYSQL_PASSWORD = 'your-password-here'
3. Run app.py
